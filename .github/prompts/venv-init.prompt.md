# Initialize Python Virtual Environment

For the repository, create a Python virtual environment in the project root directory using the UV tool and install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Steps to Follow
1. **Check for UV Installation**: Ensure that the UV tool is installed. If not, provide instructions to install it.
2. **Create Virtual Environment**: Use UV to create a virtual environment in the root directory of the project.
3. **Activate Virtual Environment**: Provide instructions on how to activate the virtual environment.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` into the virtual environment.
5. **Verification**: Verify that the dependencies have been installed correctly.
6. **Initialize the Virtual Environment**: Perform the initialization commands to initialize and activate the virtual environment.

## Guidelines
- **MANDATORY**: Remove old virtual environment folders if they exist before creating a new one.
- **MANDATORY**: Do not modify any files other than those related to the virtual environment setup.
- **OPTIONAL**: Provide additional instructions for common issues that may arise during setup.
- **OPTIONAL**: Suggest best practices for managing the virtual environment and dependencies.
