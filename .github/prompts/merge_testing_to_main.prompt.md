# Merge Testing Branch into Main Branch

This prompt is designed to help finalize the integration of changes from the `testing` branch into the `main` branch of the DFBU repository.

## üîì Branch Protection Exception

**IMPORTANT:** When this prompt is executed by a human using the `/merge_testing_to_main` command, AI agents are authorized to modify the `main` branch as part of the merge process. This is an explicit exception to the standard branch protection policy that prohibits AI agents from autonomously modifying `main`.

## Prerequisites

Before running this prompt, ensure you have completed the merge preparation checklist:

1. ‚úÖ All tests are passing (or documented exceptions explained)
2. ‚úÖ No merge conflicts with `main` branch
3. ‚úÖ Documentation is up to date
4. ‚úÖ Changelog reflects all changes
5. ‚úÖ Code review completed
6. ‚úÖ Currently on `testing` branch

## Merge Process

This prompt will guide you through the following steps:

### Step 1: Final Status Check

Verify current branch and status:

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
```

Ensure you are on the `testing` branch with no uncommitted changes.

### Step 2: Commit Any Remaining Changes

If there are any uncommitted changes, commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: final merge preparation updates"
```

### Step 3: Push Testing Branch to Remote

Ensure the testing branch is up to date on the remote:

```bash
git push origin testing
```

### Step 4: Switch to Main Branch

Switch to the main branch and ensure it's up to date:

**Note:** This step involves switching to and modifying the `main` branch, which is normally prohibited for AI agents. However, since this is a human-initiated merge process using the `/merge_testing_to_main` command, AI agents are authorized to perform these operations.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 5: Merge Testing into Main

Merge the testing branch into main using the project's preferred strategy:

**Option A: Merge Commit (Preserves History)**

```bash
git merge testing --no-ff -m "Merge testing branch - Updates and improvements"
```

**Option B: Squash and Merge (Clean History)**

```bash
git merge testing --squash
git commit -m "Merge testing branch - Updates and improvements

[Summarize the changes being merged from testing branch]
"
```

### Step 6: Push Main Branch to Remote

Push the merged main branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Verify Merge Success

Confirm the merge was successful:

```bash
git log --oneline -10
git diff origin/main..HEAD
```

The diff should show no differences if the push was successful.

### Step 8: Post-Merge Tasks

After successful merge:

1. **Keep testing branch for ongoing development**:

   ```bash
   git checkout testing
   git merge main  # Sync testing with main
   ```

2. **Run tests to verify everything works**:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest DFBU/tests/ -v
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** The project maintains `testing` branch for active development. Do not delete it.

## Rollback Procedure

If something goes wrong after merging to main, you can rollback:

### Before Pushing to Remote

If you haven't pushed yet:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Undo the merge commit
```

### After Pushing to Remote

If you've already pushed:

```bash
# Create a revert commit
git revert -m 1 HEAD
git push origin main
```

Or reset to a specific commit (requires force push):

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash-before-merge>
git push origin main --force
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use force push with extreme caution** - coordinate with team first.

## Known Issues

### Test Status

Check current test status with:

```bash
uv run pytest DFBU/tests/ -v
```

**Note:** Per project guidelines:

- Project uses "confident design patterns"
- Error handling deferred to v1.0.0 (unless critical)
- Tests should focus on happy path and core functionality before v1.0.0

**Action Required:** Review and document any failing tests before merge

## Merge Checklist Summary

- [ ] Verify current branch is `testing`
- [ ] Commit any uncommitted changes
- [ ] Push testing branch to remote
- [ ] Switch to main branch
- [ ] Pull latest main branch
- [ ] Merge testing into main (choose strategy)
- [ ] Push main branch to remote
- [ ] Verify merge success
- [ ] Run tests on main branch
- [ ] Complete post-merge tasks
- [ ] Document merge in project tracking

## Success Criteria

The merge is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ Main branch contains all testing branch commits
2. ‚úÖ No merge conflicts remain
3. ‚úÖ Tests pass on main branch
4. ‚úÖ Remote repository updated
5. ‚úÖ Project documentation reflects merge
6. ‚úÖ Changelog is up to date

## Additional Notes

- **Branch Strategy**: The project maintains `main` for stable releases and `testing` for active development
- **Code Changes Policy**: All code changes MUST go through `testing` branch first
- **Documentation**: Should be updated in `testing` branch and merged with code changes
- **Version Numbering**: After merge, consider if next version should increment MINOR or PATCH

## Support

If you encounter issues during the merge process:

1. Check the repository's GitHub Issues page
2. Review the project's documentation in `/DFBU/docs/`
3. Consult the CHANGELOG.md for recent changes
4. Refer to the merge_prep.prompt.md for preparation details
