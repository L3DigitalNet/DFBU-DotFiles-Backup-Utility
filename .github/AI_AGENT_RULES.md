# AI Agent Rules - Quick Reference

## üö® RULE #1: NEVER MODIFY `main` BRANCH üö®

### Before EVERY code change, run

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

### If output is `main`

```bash
git checkout testing
git branch --show-current  # Verify it says "testing"
```

### Only proceed with changes if on `testing` branch

## Standard Response Template

When asked to make changes while on `main`:

```
I cannot make code changes on the main branch per repository policy.
I need to switch to the testing branch first.

Let me verify the current branch and switch to testing:
[Run git commands to verify and switch]

Now I can proceed with your requested changes on the testing branch.
```

## Emergency Override

**There is NO emergency override.**

Even for critical bugs:

1. Make fix on `testing` branch
2. Human reviews
3. Human merges to `main`
