| Branch Protection | [BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) | All contributor docs |
| Testing | [tests/README.md](../DFBU/tests/README.md) | CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md |

When updating these topics, update the canonical source first, then verify summaries in other documents remain accurate.
